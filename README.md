DopeWars.js
===========

A drug-dealing game set in streets of Montreal City.

## About

DopeWars.js was written by Nicolas Hurtubise. This game was inspired by the UNIX rewrite of the MS-DOS program Dope Wars, which in turn was inspired by John E. Dell's "Drug Wars" game. Yup, that game has a long history. Though it's probably the first one to implement drug-consuming.
