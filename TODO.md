Stuff to do.

For each bug you resolve, you get **300 Points** and for each feature you implement, you get **1000 points** !¹

## Bugs

* Errors in notifications (you need more money)
* High score stockage is sketchy

## Features

* More info on handheld menu bar - City, Day, Debt, ... (fade between informations)
* Switch between different stylesheets (themes - a lighter theme would be cool)
* More languages (localization)
* Mobile interface with +1/+10/-1/-10 buttons instead of input (too violent)
* Restrict the loanable amount of money so that you can't own more than 2000$ after the loan

## Need more informations ?

I'll be happy to help you to help me :) For more information on anything dopewars.js-related (or not, I like talking with people just for fun too), you can contact me at 316k [ät] legtux [döt] org.



¹ Points are not redeemable for money, or anything valuable².
² Still, I bet some people will be graceful for what you did, and that might be considered valuable ;)
